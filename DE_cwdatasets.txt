Not only are open, accessible data formats better supported on the platform, they are also easier to work with for more people regardless of their tools. /ppThis page describes the file formats that we recommend using when sharing data on Kaggle Datasets.  Plus, learn why and how to make less well-supported file types as accessible as possible to the data science community. /p    h4 id=supported-file-typesSupported File Types/h4        h5 id=csvsCSVs/h5        pThe simplest and best-supported file type available on Kaggle is the Comma-Separated List, or CSV, for tabular data.  CSVs uploaded to Kaggle should have a header row consisting of human-readable field names.  A CSV representation of a shopping list with a header row, for example, looks like this:/p        pid,type,quantity/p        p0,bananas,12/p        p1,apples,7/p        pCSVs are the most common of the file formats available on Kaggle and are the best choice for tabular data. /p        pOn the Data tab of a dataset, a preview of the files contents is visible in the data explorer.  This makes it significantly easier to understand the contents of a dataset, as it eliminates the need to open the data in a Notebook or download it locally. /p        pCSV files will also have associated column descriptions and column metadata.  The column descriptions allows you to assign descriptions to individual columns of the dataset, making it easier for users to understand what each column means.  Column metrics, meanwhile, present high-level metrics about individual columns in a graphic format. /p        pa href= Complete Pokemon Dataset/a is an example of a great CSV-type Dataset. /p        h5 id=jsonJSON/h5        pWhile CSV is the most common file format for flat data, JSON is the most common file format for tree-like data that potentially has multiple layers, like the branches on a tree:/p        p{[{id: 0, type: bananas, quantity: 12}, {id: 1, type: apples, quantity: 7}]}/p        pFor JSON files, the Data tab preview will present an interactive tree with the nodes in the JSON file attached.  You can click on individual keys to open and collapse sections of the tree, exploring the structure of the dataset as you go along.  JSON files do not support column descriptions or metrics. /p        pYou can filter the Datasets listing by File Type to show a href= datasets containing JSON files/a. /p        h5 id=sqliteSQLite/h5        pKaggle supports database files using the lightweight SQLite format.  SQLite databases consist of multiple tables, each of which contains data in tabular format.  These tables support large datasets better than CSV files do, but are otherwise similar in practice. /p        pThe Data tab represents each table in a database separately.  Like CSV files, SQLite tables will be fully populated by Column Metadata and Column Metrics sections. /p        pa href= Soccer Database/a is an example of a great SQLite-type Dataset. /p        h5 id=archivesArchives/h5        pAlthough not technically a file format per se, Kaggle also has first-class support for files compressed using the ZIP file format as well as other common archive formats like 7z. /p        pCompressed files take up less space on disk than uncompressed ones, making them significantly faster to upload to Kaggle and allowing you to upload datasets that would otherwise exceed the Dataset size limitations. /p        pArchives are uncompressed on our side so that their contents are accessible in Notebooks without requiring users to unzip them.  Archives do not currently populate previews for individual file contents, but you can still browse the contents by file name. /p        pAs a result, we recommend that you only upload your dataset as an archive if the dataset is large enough, is made up of many smaller files, or is organized into subfolders.  For instance, ZIPs and other archive formats are a great choice for making image datasets available on Kaggle. /p        pa href= X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)/a is an example of a dataset made of archived images. /p        h5 id=bigqueryBigQuery/h5        pKaggle also supports special BigQuery Datasets.  BigQuery is a big data SQL store invented by Google.  Many massive public datasets, like all the code in GitHub and the complete history of the Bitcoin blockchain, are available publically through the Google BigQuery Public Datasets initiative.  Some of these are in turn also available as Kaggle Datasets! /p        pBigQuery Datasets are special in many ways.  Because they are multi-terabyte datasets hosted on Googles servers they cannot be uploaded or downloaded.  Within Notebooks, instead of loading the files from disk, you interact with the dataset by writing SQL fetch queries within either the Google BigQuery Python library or Kaggles bq_helper library.  And, due to the large size of the datasets involved, there is a quota of 5 TB of data scanned per user per 30-days. /p        pSome resources for understanding how to use BigQuery:/p        ul style=list-style-type:disc        \tli        \t\tpa href= Started with Big Query/a/p        \t/li        \tli        \t\tpa href= Queries: Exploring the Bigquery API/a/p        \t/li        /ul        pa href= Names Data/a is an example of a BigQuery-type Dataset.  Here are some helpful Notebooks for learning more about BigQuery: a href= Scavenger Hunt Handbook/a, a href= Started with BigQuery/a, and a href= Queries: Exploring the BigQuery API/a. /p        h5 id=other-file-formatsOther File Formats/h5        pThe file formats listed in the section above are the ones best supported and most common on the Kaggle format.  This doesnt mean that other types of files cant be uploaded; any file you can think of can be uploaded.  Other formats are just less well-supported: they may not have previews or any of the other data explorer components available.  They will also likely be less familiar with Kaggle users, and hence, less accessible. /p        pIf you can convert your file into one of the formats above (the simpler the better), we highly recommend doing so.  For example, Excel spreadsheets are a proprietary format that should be uploaded as CSV files instead.  Your users will thank you! /p        pHowever, there are nevertheless use cases for alternative data formats.  We do encourage uploads in speciality data formats like NPZ, image file formats like PNG, and complex hierarchical data formats like HDF5.  But, when doing so, we suggest also uploading a Notebook discussing what and where the files are, how to work with them, and demonstrating how to get started with the dataset.  Reproducible code samples can go a long way towards making your data files accessible to the data science world! /phr width=100% align=left! --Searching for Datasets--h3 id=searching-for-datasetsSearching for Datasets/h3pDatasets is not just a simple data repository.  Each dataset is a community where you can discuss data, discover public code and techniques, and create your own projects in Notebooks.  You can find many different interesting datasets of all shapes and sizes if you take the time to look around and find them! /ppThe latest and greatest from Datasets is surfaced on Kaggle in several different places. /p    h4 id=newsfeedNewsfeed/h4    pWhen youre logged into your Kaggle account, the a href= homepage/a provides a live newsfeed of what people are doing on the platform.  New Datasets uploaded by people you follow and hot Datasets with lots of activity will show up here.  By browsing down the page you can check out all the latest updates from your fellow Kagglers. /p    pYou can tweak your news feed to your liking by following other Kagglers.  To follow someone, go to their profile page and click on Follow User.  Content posted and upvotes made by users you have followed will show up more prominently. /p    pThe same is true of other users who choose to follow you.  Post high-quality content and you will soon find other users following along with what you are doing! /p    h4 id=datasets-listingDatasets Listing/h4    pA more structured way of accessing datasets is accessible from the Datasets tab in the main menu bar. /p    pDatasets are grouped by different categories: Trending Datasets, Popular Datasets, Recently Viewed Datasets and a few other rotating categories. /p    pAt the bottom of this page, you can click on the Explore all public datasets button to get a list view of all datasets.  The list is sorted by Hotness by default.  Hotness is what it sounds like: a way of measuring the interestingness and recency of datasets on the platform.  Datasets which score highly in Hotness, and thus appear highly in this list, are usually either recently released Datasets that have been marked Reviewed and are scoring highly in engagement, or all-time greats that have been consistently popular on the platform for a long time. /p    pOther methods of sorting are by Most Votes, New, Updated and Usability. /p    pOther filtering options, available from the navigation bar, are Sizes (Small, Medium, or Large), File types (CSV, SQLite, JSON, BigQuery), Licenses (Creative Commons, GPL, Other Database, Other), and Tags (described in the next section). /p    pYou can also use the listing to view your own Datasets (Your Datasets), or to look at datasets you have previously bookmarked (Bookmarks). /p    pFinally, a Datasets-specific search bar is available here.  This is often the fastest way to find a specific dataset that you are looking for. /p    h4 id=tags-and-tag-pagesTags and Tag Pages/h4    pTags are the most advanced of the searching options available in the Datasets listing page.  Tags are added by dataset owners to indicate the topic of the Dataset, techniques you can use (e. g. , classification), or the type of the data itself (e. g. , text data).  You can navigate to tag pages to browse more content sharing a tag either by clicking on a tag on a Dataset, or by clicking on the Tags dropdown in the site header. /p    pSearching by tags allow you to search for Datasets by topical area.  For example, if you are interested in animal shelter data you might try a search with the tag animals; if you are interested in police records a search with crime would do the trick. /p    pTag pages include a section listing the most popular pages with the given tag, making them a great way of searching for datasets by content. /phr width=100% align=left! --Creating a Dataset--h3 id=creating-a-datasetCreating a Dataset/h3pIts easy to create a dataset on Kaggle and doing so is a great way to start a data science portfolio, share reproducible research, or work with collaborators on a project for work or school.  You have the option to create private datasets to work solo or with invited collaborators or publish a dataset publicly to Kaggle for anyone to view, download, and analyze. /p    h4 id=navigating-the-dataset-interfaceNavigating the Dataset Interface/h4    pTo publish a private or public dataset, start by navigating to the a href= listing/a.  There you will find a New Dataset button.  Click on it to open the New Dataset modal. /p    pThe required bare minimum fields for uploading a dataset to Kaggle in descending order are:/p    ul style=list-style-type:disc    \tli    \t\tpThe strongTitle/strong is the name of the Dataset  e. g.  what will appear in the listing when searching or browsing. /p    \t/li    \tli    \t\tpThe strongURL/strong is the link the Dataset will live at.  The slug will first auto-populate and mimic your Title.  However, you can hover over the slug to change it right away. /p    \t/li    \tli    \t\tpFinally, you may upload data from one of four sources:/p    \t\tul    \t\t    listrongYour local machine/strong - upload files/folders via drag and drop or by selecting them in your file browser.

Feel free to navigate away from the browser window whilst processing is inflight as it will continue in the background. /p    pYour datasets has now been created!  However, for truly great Datasets, the work doesnt stop there.  Once you have specified the required fields there are a few other things you should do in order to maximize your datasets usefulness to the community or your collaborators:/p    ul style=list-style-type:disc    \tli    \t\tpUpload a cover image.  We recommend using a href= for shareable, high resolution images. /p    \t/li    \tli    \t\tpAdd a subtitle to the dataset.  This is a short bit of text explaining in slightly more detail what is in it.  This subtitle will appear alongside the title in the search listings. /p    \t/li    \tli    \t\tpAdd tags.  Tags help users find datasets on topics they are interested in by making them easier to find. /p    \t/li    \tli    \t\tpAdd a description.  The description should explain what the dataset is about in long-form text.  A great description is extremely useful to Kaggle community members looking to get started with your data. /p    \t/li    \tli    \t\tpPublish a public Notebook.  Use Notebooks to show community members or your collaborators how to get started with the data.  This can be something simple like an exploratory data analysis or a more complex project reproducing research using the data. /p    \t/li    /ul    pA few examples of well-formatted datasets are a href= Competitive Matchmaking Data/a, a href= Dataset/a, a href= million UK traffic accidents/a, and a href= MNIST/a. /p    h4 id=creating-datasets-from-various-connectorsCreating Datasets from Various Connectors/h4    pAs outlined above, in addition to uploading files from your local machine, you can also create Datasets from various data sources including GitHub, remote URLs (any public file hosted on the web), and Notebook output files.  These are each icons that can be found in the Dataset Upload Modal sidebar. /p        h5GitHub and Remote File Datasets/h5        pDatasets created from a GitHub repository or hosted (remote) files are downloaded directly from the remote server to Kaggles cloud storage and, therefore, will consume none of your local networks bandwidth.  This makes the remote files connector a convenient solution for creating datasets from large files. /p        pWhen a dataset is created from a github repository or hosted file, the publisher is able to set up automatic interval updates from the datasets Settings tab.  Heres an example a href= market dataset/a that updates daily.          pDont want to wait for a refresh?  No problem!  Click the Update button within the ...  dropdown in the dataset menu header to sync your dataset immediately. /p        h5Notebook Output File Datasets/h5        pCreating a dataset from a Notebooks output files will let you create reproducible data pipelines.  To create a dataset from a Notebooks output files, click on the icon in the uploader and search for your Notebook.  Alternatively, you can click Create Dataset from the Output tab on your rendered Notebook.  Then, select the files you want to use in your dataset. /p        h5Limitations/h5        pIts worth noting that for user experience and technical simplicity, a dataset can be created and versioned from exclusively one data source.  That is, data sources currently can not be mixed and matched in any given dataset (for example, a dataset created from a GitHub repository cant also include files uploaded from your local machine).  If you would like to use various different data sources in a Notebook you can create multiple datasets and add them both to said Notebook.         pThe usual technical specifications for dataset creation apply to connectors too.  See the a href= Specifications/a section for more information. /p    h4 id=Updating Dataset using JSON ConfigUpdating Dataset Using JSON Config/h4    pFor advanced users, you may find it easier to update key parameters of your dataset by specifying the details as JSON configuration.  To do this, navigate to your dataset and click Settings, followed by  JSON Config in the menu of options on the left. /p    pYou can update any of the settings you would normally edit through the datasets user interface, such as title, collaborators, licenses, keywords and more.  For a reference to the schema you can use for updating dataset settings, you can look at our a href=  documentation/a for the relevant actions within the Public API. /ppPlease note, there are some subtle differences between the Public API schema and the schema supported in the JSON Config settings UI.  They are as follows: /p    ul style=list-style-type:disc    \tli    \t\tpstrongid/strong is omitted as it cannot be changed after dataset creation/p    \t/li    \tli    \t\tp strongresources/strong is omitted as you cannot change the uploaded files using this UI /p    \t/li    \tli    \t\tpThe strongisPrivate/strong is an added boolean option that allows users to change the privacy of their datasets (note: public datasets can NOT be made private)/p    \t/li    \tli    \t\tpstrongcollaborators/strong is an added array of objects with shape code{ username: string; role: read | write}/code that can be used to specify dataset collaborators/p    \t/li    /ulhr width=100% align=left! --Collaborating on Datasets--h3 id=collaborating-on-datasetsCollaborating on Datasets/h3pDataset collaboration is a powerful feature.  It allows multiple users to co-own and co-maintain a private or publicly shared dataset.  For example, you can invite collaborators to view and edit a private dataset to work together on preparing it before changing its visibility to public. /ppWhen uploading a Dataset you may choose either yourself or any Organization you are a part of as the Owner of that Dataset.  If you select yourself, that Dataset will be created with yourself as the Owner.  If you select an Organization, that Organization will be the Owner of the dataset, and every other user in the Organization (including yourself) will be added as a Collaborator with editing privileges (if you are unfamiliar with Organizations, you may also want to read the section Creating and using organizations). /ppThis means that Organizations are an easy way to manage access to datasets or groups of datasets. /p    h4 id=inviting-collaboratorsInviting Collaborators/h4    pAlternatively, you may manage Collaborators directly.  To do so, go to any dataset you own and navigate to Settings gt; Sharing.  There, use the search box to find and add other users as Dataset collaborators. /p    pIf your Dataset is private, you may choose between giving Collaborators either viewing privileges (Can view) or editing privileges (Can edit).  If your Dataset is public, Collaborators can only be added with editing privileges (Can edit), as anyone can view it already. /p    pWhen you add a collaborator, they will receive a notification via email. /p    pa href= Science for Good: Kiva Crowdfunding/a is a great example of a Collaborative Dataset. /p    h4 id=using-notebooks-with-dataset-collaboratorsUsing Notebooks with Dataset Collaborators/h4    pUsing Notebooks, Kaggles interactive code editing and execution environment, is a powerful way to work with your collaborators on a Dataset.  You might want to work with collaborators to write public Notebooks that help familiarize other users with your dataset.  Or you may want to keep all of your code private among your collaborators as you work on privately shared projects together. /p    pNotebooks you create are private by default, and their sharing settings are distinct from the sharing settings on your Dataset.  That is, your Dataset collaborators wont automatically see your private Notebooks.
